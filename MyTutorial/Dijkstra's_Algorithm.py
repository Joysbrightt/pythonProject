# todo learning about Dijkstra's Algorithm Dijkstra’s algorithm, each edge in the graph has a number associated with
#  it. These are called weights. A graph with weights is called a weighted graph.
# To calculate the shortest path in a weighted graph, use Dijkstra’s algorithm

# todo A graph without weights is called an unweighted graph.
# To calculate the shortest path in an unweighted graph, use breadth-first search.
