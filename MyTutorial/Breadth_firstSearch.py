# Todo GRAPHS ARE THE WAYS TO SORT A FIND THE SHORTEST PATH PROBLEM

# GRAPHS: Are made up nodes and edges. A node can be directly connected to many other nodes
# A Graph consists of several nodes and each node are called its neighbours.
#todo Breadth_first search takes O(number of perople + number of edges), written as O(V + E
#TODO where V-> number of vertices, E-> for number of edges
#TODO A directed graph has arrows, and the relationship follows the direction of the arrow
#TODO Undirected graphs donâ€™t have arrows, and the relationship goes both ways
# Todo QUEUES
